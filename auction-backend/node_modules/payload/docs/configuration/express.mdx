Payload utilizes a few Express-specific middleware packages within its own routers. You can customize how they work by passing in configuration options to the main Payload config's `express` property.

### JSON

`express.json()` is used to parse JSON body content into JavaScript objects accessible on the Express `req`. Payload allows you to customize all of the `json` method's options. Common examples of customization use-cases are increasing the max allowed JSON body size which defaults to `2MB`.

**Example payload.config.js for how to increase the max JSON size allowed to be sent to Payload endpoints:**

```js
{
	express: {
		json: {
			limit: '4mb',
		}
	}
}
```

You can find a list of all available options that are able to be passed to `express.json()` [here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html).

### Compression

Payload uses the `compression` package to optimize transfer size for all of the routes it opens, and you can pass customization options through the Payload config.

To customize compression options, pass an object to the Payload config's `express` property.

**Example payload.config.js:**

```js
{
	express: {
		compression: {
			// settings go here
		}
	}
}
```

Typically, the default options for this package are suitable. However, for a list of all available customization options, [click here](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/compression.html).
