Payload provides a variety of powerful hooks that can be used within your own React components. With them, you can interface with Payload itself and build just about any type of complex customization you can think ofâ€”directly in familiar React code.

### useField

The `useField` hook is used internally within every applicable Payload field component, and it manages sending and receiving a field's state from its parent form.

Outside of internal use, its most common use-case is in custom `Field` components. When you build a custom React `Field` component, you'll be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself. To do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:

```tsx
import { useField } from 'payload/components/forms'

type Props = { path: string }

const CustomTextField: React.FC<Props> = ({ path }) => {
  // highlight-start
  const { value, setValue } = useField<string>({ path })
  // highlight-end

  return <input onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value.path} />
}
```

The `useField` hook accepts an `args` object and sends back information and helpers for you to make use of:

```ts
const field = useField<string>({
  path: 'fieldPathHere', // required
  validate: myValidateFunc, // optional
  disableFormData?: false, // if true, the field's data will be ignored
  condition?: myConditionHere, // optional, used to skip validation if condition fails
})

// Here is what `useField` sends back
const {
  showError, // whether or not the field should show as errored
  errorMessage, // the error message to show, if showError
  value, // the current value of the field from the form
  formSubmitted, // if the form has been submitted
  formProcessing, // if the form is currently processing
  setValue, // method to set the field's value in form state
  initialValue, // the initial value that the field mounted with
} = field;

// The rest of your component goes here
```

### useFormFields

There are times when a custom field component needs to have access to data from other fields, and you have a few options to do so. The `useFormFields` hook is a powerful and highly performant way to retrieve a form's field state, as well as to retrieve the `dispatchFields` method, which can be helpful for setting other fields' form states from anywhere within a form.

  <strong>This hook is great for retrieving only certain fields from form state</strong> because it ensures that it will only cause a rerender when the items that you ask for change. 
</Banner>

Thanks to the awesome package [`use-context-selector`](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector), you can retrieve a specific field's state easily. This is ideal because you can ensure you have an up-to-date field state, and your component will only re-render when _that field's state_ changes.

You can pass a Redux-like selector into the hook, which will ensure that you retrieve only the field that you want. The selector takes an argument with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`.

```tsx
import { useFormFields } from 'payload/components/forms';

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Get only the `amount` field state, and only cause a rerender when that field changes
  const amount = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.amount);

  // Do the same thing as above, but to the `feePercentage` field
  const feePercentage = useFormFields(([fields, dispatch]) => fields.feePercentage);

  if (typeof amount?.value !== 'undefined' && typeof feePercentage?.value !== 'undefined') {
    return (
      <span>The fee is ${(amount.value * feePercentage.value) / 100}</span>
    );
  }
};
```

### useAllFormFields

**To retrieve more than one field**, you can use the `useAllFormFields` hook. Your component will re-render when _any_ field changes, so use this hook only if you absolutely need to. Unlike the `useFormFields` hook, this hook does not accept a "selector", and it always returns an array with type of `[fields: Fields, dispatch: React.Dispatch<Action>]]`. 

You can do lots of powerful stuff by retrieving the full form state, like using built-in helper functions to reduce field state to values only, or to retrieve sibling data by path.

```tsx
import { useAllFormFields, reduceFieldsToValues, getSiblingData } from 'payload/components/forms';

const ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // the `fields` const will be equal to all fields' state,
  // and the `dispatchFields` method is usable to send field state up to the form
  const [fields, dispatchFields] = useAllFormFields();

  // Pass in fields, and indicate if you'd like to "unflatten" field data.
  // The result below will reflect the data stored in the form at the given time
  const formData = reduceFieldsToValues(fields, true);

  // Pass in field state and a path, 
  // and you will be sent all sibling data of the path that you've specified
  const siblingData = getSiblingData(fields, 'someFieldName');

  return (
    // return some JSX here if necessary
  )
};
```

##### Updating other fields' values

If you are building a custom component, then you should use `setValue` which is returned from the `useField` hook to programmatically set your field's value. But if you're looking to update _another_ field's value, you can use `dispatchFields` returned from `useFormFields`.

You can send the following actions to the `dispatchFields` function.

| Action                 | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`ADD_ROW`**          | Adds a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                    |
| **`DUPLICATE_ROW`**    | Duplicates a row of data (useful in array / block field data)              |
| **`MODIFY_CONDITION`** | Updates a field's conditional logic result (true / false)                  |
| **`MOVE_ROW`**         | Moves a row of data (useful in array / block field data)                   |
| **`REMOVE`**           | Removes a field from form state                                            |
| **`REMOVE_ROW`**       | Removes a row of data from form state (useful in array / block field data) |
| **`REPLACE_STATE`**    | Completely replaces form state                                             |
| **`UPDATE`**           | Update any property of a specific field's state                            |

To see types for each action supported within the `dispatchFields` hook, check out the Form types [here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/components/forms/Form/types.ts).

### useForm

The `useForm` hook can be used to interact with the form itself, and sends back many methods that can be used to reactively fetch form state without causing rerenders within your components each time a field is changed. This is useful if you have action-based callbacks that your components fire, and need to interact with form state _based on a user action_.

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong><br/>
  This hook is optimized to avoid causing rerenders when fields change, and as such, its `fields` property will be out of date. You should only leverage this hook if you need to perform actions against the form in response to your users' actions. Do not rely on its returned "fields" as being up-to-date. They will be removed from this hook's response in an upcoming version. 
</Banner>

The `useForm` hook returns an object with the following properties:

| Action               | Description                                                         |

  // id will be undefined on the create form
  if (!id) {
    return null;
  }

  return (

### useLocale

In any custom component you can get the selected locale with the `useLocale` hook. Here is a simple example:

    es: 'Hola',
  };

  return (
    <span> { trans[locale] } </span>
  );
};
```

### useAuth

Useful to retrieve info about the currently logged in user as well as methods for interacting with it. It sends back an object with the following properties:

| Property            | Description                                                                             |

import { useAuth } from 'payload/components/utilities';
import { User } from '../payload-types.ts';

const Greeting: React.FC = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { user } = useConfig<User>();
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <span>Hi, {user.email}!</span>
