### Adding your own CSS / SCSS

You can add your own CSS by providing your base Payload config with a path to your own CSS or SCSS. Customize the styling of any part of the Payload dashboard as necessary.

To do so, provide your base Payload config with a path to your own stylesheet. It can be either a CSS or SCSS file.

**Example in payload.config.js:**
```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import path from 'path';

const config = buildConfig({
	admin: {
		css: path.resolve(__dirname, 'relative/path/to/stylesheet.scss'),
	},
});
```

### Overriding built-in styles

To make it as easy as possible for you to override our styles, Payload uses [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com/) for all CSS within the Admin UI. If you provide your own CSS, you can override any built-in styles easily.

In addition to adding your own style definitions, you can also override Payload's built-in CSS variables. We use as much as possible behind the scenes, and you can override any of them that you'd like to.

You can find the built-in Payload CSS variables within [`./src/admin/scss/app.scss`](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/scss/app.scss) and [`./src/admin/scss/colors.scss`](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/master/src/admin/scss/colors.scss). The following variables are defined and can be overridden:

- Breakpoints
- Base color shades (white to black by default)
- Success / warning / error color shades
- Theme-specific colors (background, input background, text color, etc.)
- Elevation colors (used to determine how "bright" something should be when compared to the background)
- Fonts
- Horizontal gutter

#### Dark mode

<Banner type="warning">
  If you're overriding colors or theme elevations, make sure to consider how your changes will affect dark mode.
</Banner>

By default, Payload automatically overrides all `--theme-elevation`s and inverts all success / warning / error shades to suit dark mode. We also update some base theme variables like `--theme-bg`, `--theme-text`, etc.
